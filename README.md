# Distributed System project 2017-2018

Uminho Distributed system project

## Getting Started

Clone this repository and compile the sources. 
Pro tip: Use an IDE to do it for you, maven is great and so are you.

### Prerequisites

Definitely need Java.
Patience is a plus, but really, to code in java, you already have that.

### Installing

Jvm
Javac
Thats all folks

## Running the tests

Tests? Oh right. Try running the Bot. Pump those numbers to 4000 threads and watch a failsafe program not be so failsafe.

### Coding style tests
Lint was on vacation, so were we up to 3 days before the deadline, soooo, no lint.

### Future work
- [ ] Deploying lint on this sucker
